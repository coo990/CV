As a recent bootcamp graduate from [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), I am a dedicated, enthusiastic and career driven individual, who is always eager to learn and take on new challenges. 

I pride myself on my soft skills of attention to detail, teamwork and communication after previously working in sales for start-up companies for the past four years and having a passion for technology. I am excited in my journey to start my new career as a Software Developer.
