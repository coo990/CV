# Chuka Okoye-Ahaneku

As a Junior Full-Stack Developer based in London, I have experience with both web and database technologies. Due to my passion for technology from an early age and a desire to solve real-world problems, I became a software developer after working in sales for four years for start-ups. As well as my dedication, enthusiasm, and career-driven nature, I enjoy learning new skills and taking on new challenges.

It is my strength to pay attention to details, work well in teams, and communicate effectively. As I mentioned previously, I have been involved in sales for start-up companies for the last four years, and I am now looking forward to applying those skills towards my career as a Software Developer.

I go more in-depth with my passion for technology in my blog, so please check out: https://chukaokoye93.medium.com/

### Skills
- **Constant learner** - Can transfer between languages (Ruby and Javascript) as I love to code. While still eager to learn new technologies like React.
- **Enthusiasm** - I am always eager to contribute to a project, unafraid to add my ideas to a conversation, like enquiring about which coding tasks are more important. 
- **Teamwork** - I enjoy working in both team environments whilst being confident enough to work independently. Always getting positive feedback during pair programming sessions and team projects.
- **Written and Verbal Communication Skills** - I held multiple presentations on business development plans at my previous jobs and wrote a [blog][4] that details my entire 12-week Makers Academy duration.
- **Attention to detail** - I am good at spotting key items when doing code reviews or pair programming, which has dramatically improved when debugging.
- **Flexibility** - Easily adaptable to taking on available duties, and very comfortable working with new people effectively.
